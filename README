Iki Media Manager - http://iki-project.org

Iki is a set of tools to manage media files. The main part of iki
consists of a webservice and a website (a web client). But iki is not
only the web client. There is (or will be) a *desktop* client (written
either in python or C/C++ or..), some f-spot (http://f-spot.org)
plug-ins, etc..

Features
========

.. Here are the **main** feature to highlight


Dependencies
============

.. Here are the dependencies
   3 type of dependencies : Python, Django & other (like tools,
   libraries, ..)


Installation
============

See the INSTALL file and/or the documentation
(http://iki-project/documentation) to know how to install iki.


Configuration
=============

I'm probably repeating with the INSTALL file but in order to get the
django project working, you should create a settings_local.py as
following (with your own settings)

.. sourcecode: python

   #!/usr/bin/env python
   # -*- encoding: utf-8 -*-
   import os
   import sys
   
   DEVELOPMENT = True
   if DEVELOPMENT:
       SHARED_PATH = os.path.normpath("/home/demeester/src/pythonpath")
       sys.path.append(SHARED_PATH)
           
       SECRET_KEY = 'c$-=)-qw&fp@&)m9$5=+)-!4ja*#xiyis6&fd$@@i7o1r+nj8r'
           
       DATABASE_ENGINE = 'sqlite3'
       DATABASE_NAME = os.path.join(os.path.abspath(os.path.split(__file__)[0]), 'db/iki.db')

In this example (it's my own settings_local.py -- vdemeester), I just
modify the PYTHONPATH in order to let know python about all local
package that are a dependency for iki. 

It's also in this file you should define the Database settings, like
you do in any django project.
